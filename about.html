        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Born in 1997 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, Nhi Dam was brought up in a moderately wealthy Catholic family
            with one sister. From an early age, she was introduced to a holistic education that ranged from outdoor
            sports, formal subjects, arts, to classical teachings like the piano. Navigating the challenges of being an
            international student in America, she has gracefully blended her traditional Asian values with the new
            perspectives she gained in the US. Her journey is a testament to resilience, adaptability, and the power of
            open-mindedness.
        </p>

        <h2>Beliefs & Values</h2>
        <p>
            Central to Nhi's life are her core beliefs. She champions a diligent work ethic, believing that hard work in
            the early stages of life paves the way for a secure future. Additionally, honoring parents is paramount for
            Nhi. As they cared for us during our vulnerable years, it becomes our duty to reciprocate that love and care
            during their twilight years. Deeply rooted in her faith, Nhi sees faith as the guiding light in the
            murkiness of life's challenges.
        </p>

        <h2>Integration & Identity</h2>
        <p>
            Nhi's journey in America speaks volumes of her adaptability. While she flawlessly converses in English and
            has embraced various facets of American culture, she remains deeply connected to her Vietnamese roots. This
            duality is evident in her day-to-day life, from seamlessly switching between languages to her culinary
            preferences. Her ability to celebrate both cultures is truly admirable.
